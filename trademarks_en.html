    <h2><a name="do_i_need_one" id="do_i_need_one"></a>Do I Need Trade Mark Registration?</h2>
    <p> If you provide goods and services, then the benefits of trade mark registration include</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Exclusive rights</strong> - you can stop and prevent unauthorised use of a trade mark (e.g. copycats). Without registration, you can only stop and prevent unauthorised use if your reputation has been established in the trade mark.</li>
      <li><strong>Nationwide protection </strong>- registration gives protection to your trade mark across Australia. Without registration, your rights are generally limited to the areas in which you can prove a reputation.</li>
      <li><strong>Valuable asset</strong> - a registered trade mark is a valuable asset which can be licensed or sold.</li>
      <li><strong>Cost effective enforcement</strong> - once registered, reputation in the trade mark does not have to be established in order to obtain relief from infringement. Proving reputation can often be a difficult and costly exercise.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a name="top_3_misconceptions" id="top_3_misconceptions"></a>You Might Not Know</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Business name, company name or domain name <strong>does not</strong> give you <strong>proprietary rights</strong> to use that name as a trade mark.</li>
      <li>Registration of a trade mark is <strong>less expensive</strong> than you may think.  (Please contact Yike for a quote)</li>
      <li>You can use the trade mark <strong>before</strong> being granted official registration and <strong>even before </strong>filing the application. There is no need to wait.</li>
    </ul>     
    <h2><a name="not_just_a_word" id="not_just_a_word"></a>What Can Be A Trade Mark?</h2>
    <p> Trade marks are used to <strong>distinguish </strong>goods and services and come in different types including</p>
    <ul>
      <li>words</li>
      <li>names</li>
      <li>numbers</li>
      <li>logos</li>
      <li>pictures</li>
      <li>aspects of packaging</li>
      <li>shapes</li>
      <li>colours</li>
      <li>scents</li>
      <li>sounds</li>
      <li>combinations of the above    </li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a name="registration_in_australia" id="registration_in_australia"></a>Registration In Australia</h2>
    <p> In Australia, the registration process includes</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Trade mark search</li>
      <li>Preparation and lodgement of applications</li>
      <li>Examination</li>
      <li>Application acceptance</li>
      <li>Advertisement for opposition</li>
      <li>Trade mark registration    </li>
      </ul>
    <p>The detailed registration process including typical steps (green with unbroken lines) is shown below</p><p><img src="_images/TradeMarkProcess.png" width="535" height="678" alt="Registration Process" /></p><p></p>
    <h3><a name="trade_mark_search" id="trade_mark_search"></a>Trade Mark Search</h3>
    <p>Although a trade mark  search is not mandatory for registration purposes, it is <strong>crucial</strong> to reducing your  risks and legal costs.  A search should  be conducted <strong>before</strong> using your trade mark for marketing and labelling your  goods and services.</p><p>A trade mark clearance search will </p>
    <ul>
        <li>disclose whether your trade mark is <strong>available</strong> for registration</li>
        <li>identify whether your trade mark will <strong>infringe</strong> the rights of other  traders</li>
        <li>minimise <strong>objections</strong> being raised during the registration process </li>
        <li>minimise the <strong>risk</strong> of a trade mark dispute arising later</li>
    </ul>
	<div id="yike_service">
    <p>Yike provides these searches</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>basic search</strong> – preliminary database search for identical  registered and pending marks for all classes of goods and services </li>
        <li><strong>standard search</strong> – in-depth database search for identical and  similar registered and pending trade marks for all classes of goods and  services</li>
        <li><strong>comprehensive database search</strong> –   full database search for identical and similar registered and pending trade marks, and search for unregistered   (common law) trade marks.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>A <strong>report</strong> will be provided for each type of search with advice on <strong>class  identification</strong> of your trade mark based on the description of the goods  and services provided, the <strong>registrability</strong> of a proposed trade mark, and the <strong>risks</strong> associated with adopting a proposed mark. </p>
    <p>Sample search reports are <strong>available on request</strong>.</p></div>
    <h3><a name="preparation_and_lodgement_of_applications" id="preparation_and_lodgement_of_applications"></a>Preparation And Lodgement Of Applications</h3>
    <p>There are important <strong>decisions</strong> you have to make when preparing an application. These decisions will determine  the boundaries of your trade mark&rsquo;s protection and include determination of</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the identity of the applicant;</li>
        <li>the critical elements of your branding. These may include the name of  your business or company; the names of your goods and services; or distinctive  elements of your packaging;</li>
        <li>appropriate descriptions of the goods and services you  actually trade in or intend to trade in the near future; and</li>
        <li>the class or classes to be included in the registration.</li>
      </ul>
    <div id="yike_service"><p>Yike will work with you to ensure that the most appropriate part  of your brand is trade marked.</p></div>
    <p>Please <strong>note</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Business and trading names cannot own property; therefore, an  application should be in the name(s) of the owner(s) of the business name  registration or company (if the business is an incorporated entity).</li>
        <li>Once your application is filed and published, you cannot add any goods  or services.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3><a name="basic_filing_requirements" id="basic_filing_requirements"></a>Basic Filing Requirements</h3>
      <p>In Australia, no power of attorney or authorisation of agent form  is required.
      The following basic information is required to file a trade mark  application in Australia.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the applicant&rsquo;s full name and address &nbsp;including  incorporation details if the applicant is an Australian company</li>
        <li>a clear representation of the trade mark if it contains a device</li>
        <li>the class(es) in which the application is to be filed</li>
        <li>a statement of goods and/or services for which registration is to  be sought</li>
        <li>details of convention priority claim (if any)</li>
        <li>an address for service in Australia (if overseas applicant)</li>
      </ul>
    <h3><a name="examination" id="examination"></a>Examination</h3>
    <p>Your trade mark application will generally be examined <strong>three to  four months</strong> after filing.<br />
      If the examiner decides:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>your application meets all the requirements, your trade mark will  be accepted for registration; or</li>
        <li>your application does not meet all the requirements, an adverse  report will be issued.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Some of the most common grounds outlined in an adverse report for rejection  are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>your trade mark does not distinguish your goods and/or services</li>
        <li>your trade mark contains words or phrases that other traders are  likely to use</li>
        <li>your trade mark is identical or substantially similar to another  trade mark</li>
      </ul>
    <p>You will have <strong>15 months</strong> from the time the adverse report issued  for you to address their concerns.</p>
      <div id="yike_service"><p>If an adverse report is issued, Yike can help you with</p>
    <ul>
        <li>analysing the grounds for rejection outlined in the adverse report  and advising on the options in overcoming them</li>
        <li>collecting evidence and providing guidance for you to collect  evidence to support your response (if necessary)</li>
        <li> drafting a response to the adverse report</li>
        <li>drafting a statutory declaration with supporting evidence to  respond to the adverse report (if necessary)</li>
      </ul>
    <p>If your application has been rejected after filing the evidence,  you can choose to have the matter heard before a registrar. Should such needs  arise, Yike can represent you during the hearing.</p></div>
      <h3><a name="application_acceptance" id="application_acceptance"></a>Application Acceptance</h3>
      <p>Once an application has been accepted, a Notice of Advertisement  of the Acceptance of the trade mark will be sent to the applicant.</p>
      <h3><a name="advertisement_for_opposition" id="advertisement_for_opposition"></a>Advertisement For Opposition</h3>
      <p>A trademark opposition is a proceeding in which a third party can    object to an application   under the&nbsp;<em>Trade  Marks Act 1995</em>&nbsp;(including an application to register a trade mark). <br />
        An opposition can be filed with IP Australia within <strong>three months</strong> of the advertised date.  <br />
        Please see <a href="#opposition">below</a> for more information  regarding the opposition process.</p>
      <h3><a name="trade_mark_registration" id="trade_mark_registration"></a>Trade Mark Registration</h3>
      <p>If no opposition is filed against your application, or if  opposition is unsuccessful, your trade mark will be registered upon payment of  the registration fee. Your trade mark will be registered from the date you file your  application. The initial period of registration of your trade mark lasts for  <strong>ten years</strong> from the filing date.</p>
    <h2><a name="opposition" id="opposition"></a>Opposition</h2>
    <p>Things don't always go according to plan. Your trade mark application may be opposed. If this occurs, then you will have to gather evidence to strengthen your application. </p>
    <p>On the other hand, you may want to oppose a trade mark application.</p>
    <p>In accordance  with the <em>Trade Marks Act 1995</em>, anyone  can file an opposition to applications for</p>
    <ul type="square">
      <li>a trade mark advertised as accepted</li>
      <li>a removal because of non-use</li>
      <li>an extension of more than three months</li>
      <li>an amendment to       a trade mark application</li>
      </ul>
    <h3><a name="opposition_advertised_as_accepted" id="opposition_advertised_as_accepted"></a>Opposing A Trade Mark Application Advertised As Accepted</h3>
    <p>Common reasons include</p>
    <ul type="square">
      <li>the trade mark is not distinctive</li>
      <li>the trade mark is identical or       deceptively similar to another registered or pending trade mark</li>
      <li>the trade mark applicant is not       the true owner of the trade mark</li>
      <li>the use of the trade mark is       likely to cause deception or confusion because of the reputation in       another mark</li>
      </ul>
    <p>A typical  process of opposition to registration of a trade mark includes</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Notice of  Opposition</strong> – A notice of Opposition needs to be filed within three months of  the application being advertised as accepted in the Australian Official Journal  of Trade Marks.  A single extension of  time of up to three months may be granted by the registrar under certain very  limited conditions. A copy of the notice of opposition must be served on the  applicant.</li>
        <li><strong>Evidentiary  stages</strong> – All evidence that each party  provides must be in the form of statutory  declarations and the original copy must be filed with IP Australia. <strong>No extra evidence</strong> will be admitted to  the hearing except under very special circumstances that introduction of new  evidence will be allowed. The evidentiary stages include </li>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>evidence in support</strong> of the opposition (which must be served on the  applicant within three months since the lodgement of the notice of opposition);                     
          <li><strong>evidence in answer</strong> to the opposition  (which must be served on the opponent within three months since the date on  which the applicant was served); and                     
          <li><strong>evidence  in reply</strong> to the evidence in answer (which must be served on the applicant  within three months of the date on which the applicant had served its evidence  in answer).                                
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Determining  the matter </strong>– opposition matters will be determined either at a hearing or  based on the written record. A hearing will be scheduled to decide opposition  matters if either or both parties request. As a rule, no decision will be made  by the Hearing Officer on the hearing day. A written decision will be sent to  both parties.</li>
        <li><strong>Appeal </strong>– Either  party may appeal the decision to the Federal Court.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>The opposition process can be lengthy, complex and costly, and  IP Australia  recommends involved parties (either filing or defending) to seek the assistance  of an IP Professional.</p>

    <p> Common reasons for applying to remove a trade mark for non-use </p>
    <ul>

      <li>the owner  did not ever have any intention to use the trade mark.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A  successful opposition has to prove that the trade mark has been properly used  within the relevant time period set by the <em>Trade  Marks Act 1995</em>.</p>

      <li>time  sought is excessive</li>
      <li>a party  would be adversely affected if the extension was granted</li>

<h3><a name="Classification of goods and services" id="classificaiton_of_goods_and_services_China"></a>Classification of goods and services</h3>
    <p>Although China has adopted the Nice Classification of Goods and Services (“<strong>Nice Classification</strong>”) (10th Edition, as of 1 January 2012) in the examination of trade mark applications, the Chinese Trade Marks Office (“<strong>CTMO</strong>”) has created its own unique “Book of Classification of Similar Goods and Services” (“<strong>Book of Classification</strong>”) for Chinese examiners’ reference. In accordance with the Book of Classification, each class as per the Nice Classification has been sub-classified into sub-classes. Goods that belong to different subclasses (even in the same class) are not deemed as similar and/or closely related goods for examination purposes. For example, clothing under subclass 2501 is not deemed similar to footwear under subclass 2507 or headgear under subclass 2508. Hence, identical or substantially similar marks covering goods in different subclasses can coexist in the register.s</p>
<p>It is strongly recommended that applicants refer to the Book of Classification when specifying the goods covered by the trade mark to ensure adequate protection of the mark. For example, class 25 “clothing, footwear and headgear” as per the Nice Classification has been sub-classified into 13 subclasses as follows:  </p>
<ul>
  <li>clothing (2501)</li>
  <li>textiles for babies  (2502)</li>
  <li>specialty sports apparel  (2503)</li>
  <li>waterproof clothing(2504)</li>
  <li>costumes (2506)</li>
  <li>shoes for special  purpose (2506)</li>
  <li>shoes (2507)</li>
  <li>hats (2508)</li>
  <li>socks (2509)</li>

<p>For each subclass, there are various descriptions of goods.  These descriptions are used to specify goods  in an application.  Class or sub-class  headings cannot be used to describe goods, unless the words coincide with words  used in the various descriptions of goods. <br />
A common mistake in respect of the scope of coverage of  specifications is that some specifications are not as broad as they sound for registration  purposes. For example, &ldquo;clothing&rdquo; sounds generic and applicants may believe it  covers all the goods under class 25.   However this is not true according to the Book of Classification.  Clothing only covers goods specified in class  2501, goods such as raincoats, gloves and socks are considered different  goods.  Therefore, if one registers a  trade mark for clothing, that mark cannot prevent other applicants registering exactly  the same mark for goods such as raincoats and gloves. </p>
<p>The basic government fee of RMB1,000  (approximately AUD$17) allows specification of up to 10 items of goods and/or services  in each application.  It is recommended  that at least one item from each sub-class should be included in the  application.</p>
